## 👋 Hi, I'm Joyce Onyango

I’m a data professional passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and support smarter decision-making.

I’m actively open to **Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles**, where I can apply strong analytical thinking, structured problem solving, and technical skills to uncover insights that drive business or strategic impact.

---

I focus on moving from **raw data → meaningful insight → informed decision**.

📫 Open to full-time roles, collaborations, and impact-driven data projects.
